# Terms of Service

This is a little less formally worded than other Terms of Service you
might have seen, but we're hoping that means it will be clearer, more
helpful, and more often read.

## Scope

These are our current Terms.  We may change them from time to
time, with the revised Terms applying to exchanges between you and our
service subsequent to the new Terms' effective date.  We will announce
changes on the site when they are made.  Your continued use of the site
after a Terms of Service becomes effective will be governed by the new
Terms and constitute your agreement to the Terms.

Our service allows you to communicate with others.  Information you
receive through our service is the responsibility of the original
author, and we make no claim to it's validity or accuracy (including
even the name of the original author).  You are responsible for what
you do with the information received through our service, including
whether and how you use any links to other Internet resources.

## Privacy

Our website/service uses basically the same mechanisms of data
gathering, and for basically the same purposes, as other modern
commercial websites.  In particular:
* Out site requests that your web browser store data for us in
  "[cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)" on your
  system.  We use this information to recognize you as the same person
  in the same session each time your browser requests a new page.
* We log all requests received by our servers.
    * This includes some of the information your browser sends about
      the software you're using, your system, your location, your
      networking configuration, etc.
    * We will retain (some portion of) these logs indefinitely.
    * We use these logs to debug problems, measure and anticipate our
      system's performance, to analyze how our site is used, and to
      determine how usage patterns change in response to changes we
      make.
* Web pages from our site include code that causes your browser to
  report logging and usage information to third-party analytics
  services.  For example, as of this writing we're using
  [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com),
  [newrelic.com](https://newrelic.com), and
  [mixpanel.com](https://mixpanel.com).  However, we may change the
  set of these types of services we employ at any time, without
  announcement, and without updating this example list.  The privacy
  and management of data third-parties gather on our behalf is
  determined by their Terms of Service and not ours, and we will
  likely not notify you when/if those policies change.
* We publish information summarized or otherwise derived from our
  logs, but no information from individual log entries or concerning a
  single visitor session on the site.
* We do not engage with or sell information to any third party
  service, in particular not with any businesses concerned with
  marketing for third parties, or with advertising delivery,
  targeting, or tracking.

The primary purpose of our service is communication, and most of the
ways for you to submit information are intended to publish the
information, not to keep it private.  However, there are two
categories of information submission that are not "for publication:"
* Information you provide us to make payments (your name, billing
  address, financial account information, etc.) is private.  We will
  make our best efforts to secure this information and maintain
  confidentiality, including using industry-standard (or better)
  encryption and data handling techniques.  In particular, we do not
  store most of this information ourselves, but pass it directly and
  securely to a third-party payment gateway service.  These services
  specialize in financial transactions and data security, and our use
  of one minimizes the risk that a failure of our security measures
  will result in compromising your data.
* Portions of your user profile information (such as your email
  address) marked as "private" when you enter them will not be
  intentionally published.

You take all responsibility for the choice, protection, and privacy of
your service access credentials (sign-in password and/or any other
mechanism we provide in the future).
* We have no obligation to attempt to distinguish use of our service
  by you from use by a third party who is accessing the service using
  your credentials.
* You agree to take responsibility, including indemnifying us, for any
  result of a third party using your access credentials.  Further, we
  have no obligation to attempt to restore information submitted to
  the service to a state prior to actions taken by a third party using
  your access credentials.
* A third party who has used our service by way of your access
  credentials may be subject to civil or criminal liability.  In this
  case, we will make our best effort to provide you information to
  pursue this liability.

## Copyright and Data Ownership

* You retain ownership of and copyright in all information you submit
  to us.
* By submitting, you grant us an unlimited and non-exclusive,
  irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide license to this information, to
  use, copy, reproduce, process, store, adapt, modify, publish,
  transmit, display and distribute in digital form to yourself and all
  other users of our system.  (Note, the license you grant us does not
  terminate if you choose to close your account with us.)
* You guarantee to us (indemnify us) that all information you submit
  is yours, or that you have the legal right to submit it including
  the right to grant us the license described above.
* You guarantee to us (indemnify us) that all information you submit
  is non-confidential, and that you have no expectation that we will
  maintain your information in confidence.
* Some features of our system are intended to allow you to control who
  can see the information you have submitted.  As with all
  features, we'll try to let you understand their intended operation
  and to make them operate as indicated.  However, the stated
  operation of these features do not constrain the license we have to
  your submissions, and any failure of or change in these features'
  behavior is within the license you have provided.

## Use of Service

* We have features intended to allow you and others to control what
  information you see and who sees information that you submit.  In
  addition to these, we reserve the right to remove individual pieces
  of information and/or to deactivate your account in response to
  complaints by others or as a result of your behavior in using the
  service.
* Our rights to remove and deactivate are unlimited.  Our primary
  goals in the use of these rights are to protect people from
  malicious or unwanted contact from others, and to protect the
  integrity of the service for our user community.  We have a
  [separate Code of Conduct document](coc) that lists examples of
  causes and criteria that could cause us to remove or deactivate, but
  it is not a part of these Terms, may be updated independently, does
  not limit our rights to remove or deactivate to only those cases
  listed, and does not obligate us to remove or deactivate in all
  cases that someone believes they apply.
* We are not obligated to provide an explanation in those cases where
  we remove or deactivate, any discussion with you, or any avenue of
  appeal or review.
* You agree that you won't use our service in any way or for any
  purpose that would cause harm to you or others in the event of any
  information removal or account deactivation, or any other failure on
  the part of the service, and agree to indemnify us if you break this
  agreement.

## Payment and Liability

* Our service is primarily for paying customers, but these Terms
  govern all use of the service, paid or unpaid, including anonymous
  use and use during any free or discounted periods (trial or
  otherwise).
* We may change our pricing or payment terms at any time.
* Your payment for use of the service does not obligate us to continue
  to provide you the service, even when payment is associated with a
  specific interval of time.
    * Payment does not alter our right to remove your information or
      deactivate your account.
    * Access to the service may be periodically interrupted,
      intentionally or unintentionally, with or without warning, due
      to our actions or external factors.
    * The service may be ended/withdrawn, permanently and for all
      users, at any time.
* Under no circumstances will we have be obligated to provide full or
  partial refunds of payments made for use of the service.  Choosing,
  from time to time, to return money to customers is not a waiver, and
  is understood not to establish a precedent or obligation.

    ALL INFORMATION, AND FUNCTIONS MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH
    THE SERVICE, IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT
