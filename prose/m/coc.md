*Please note: the content here is provisional.  That isn't to say we
might back off from the intended spirit of any of it, but it's been
only lightly reviewed and has lots of room for improvement.*

We intend *[myou](https://myou.pub/)* to be a community where people
need not be fearful about their interactions.  We'll discuss
challenging topics that bring on negative feelings, and we can
fiercely debate and oppose each other, but we will not attack each
other.

*myou* exists to serve users who want to participate in a community.
We will ruthlessly remove submissions and disable accounts (even of
paying users, yes without refunds) as necessary to prevent abuse or
harassment between users.

Abuse and harassment come in a lot of different flavors, and we know
that we'll never be able to discourage or prevent every attempt at it.
But that's what we want to work toward.  At a minimum we *will* have
the best tools in place for users, and our support will respond to
reports faster and more comprehensively than other social media sites.

Some kinds of abuse are easily defined (mostly of the service or
community broadly), like these:
* [doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)
* [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming)
* attempts to access portions of the service not intended to be available
  to you
* attempts to discover or use someone else's access credentials
* posting (links to) [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)
  or "mal-sites"
* automated access to the service
    * except for public search-engine spiders and bots following `robots.txt`
    * yes, we'll eventually have an API, but until then, no scripting
      or scraping&mdash;stay in the browser

But what most people mean when they talk about problems of abuse and
harassment online and in social media have to do with what is said and
who it is said about or to.

First and foremost, posts reported for abuse are assumed to be
abusive.  (Yes, illegitimate reporting is a potential avenue for abuse
that we're prepared to address.)  Posts on *myou* are a means of
communication, and we believe that the onus for being understood
clearly and for not causing distress is on the person setting out to
communicate.

That being said, not every post that someone might find objectionable
is abusive or harassing, especially if you're speaking (posting) on a
controversial topic.  In determining whether a reported post is
abusive, and what should be done with the post (and/or the poster's
account) in response, we will take into account:
* whether the post was simply published, or if it is addressed at a
  specific individual or group (if it's a reply, if it mentions
  someone specifically, if it uses a hashtag to get in front of
  person/people who are the target)
* if the post can be seen as a direct threat or incitement
* if the post is one of several similar posts made by the same person
  or made at the same time

Most of the criteria for determining if a post or poster is harassing
is independent of the content.  Even something as benign-seeming as
posting a line from Doctor Seuss would be harassing if it were done
repeatedly, uninvited and unwanted, addressed toward a specific
individual.  However, there are many kinds of content and patterns of
posting/contact that are, on their face, almost always harassing.
Rather than trying to make a comprehensive list here, note that
[ditto.today's Code of Conduct](https://ditto.today/legal/terms/)
contains a list of many common examples.

In deciding whether to take action on a post or account, we will
consider the number of people who have blocked an account or reported
a post (the same one, or others from the same account).  A pattern of
posts that cause people to block or report is indicative of ongoing
harassment, even if (previously) no individual instance had caused us
to deactivate an account.
